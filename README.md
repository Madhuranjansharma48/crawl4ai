# FastAPI Demo - Products API

A simple FastAPI application demonstrating GET and POST endpoints for product management and inventory tracking.

## Features

- **GET /**: Welcome endpoint
- **GET /products/**: Get all products
- **GET /products/{product_id}**: Get a specific product by ID
- **POST /products/**: Create a new product

## Setup

1. **Create and activate virtual environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv myenv
   myenv\Scripts\activate.ps1  # Windows PowerShell
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

3. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn main:app --reload
   ```

4. **Access the API:**
   - API: http://localhost:8000
   - Interactive docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
   - ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## API Usage Examples

### Get all products
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/products/
```

### Get product by ID
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/products/1
```

### Create a new product
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/products/" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{
  "state": "KARNATAKA",
  "commission": "Bangalore 1st & Rural Additional",
  "searchValue": "Reddy"
}'
```

## Models

### Product
- `id`: integer
- `name`: string
- `description`: string
- `price`: float
- `quantity`: integer

## Built With

- [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/) - Modern, fast web framework for building APIs
- [Pydantic](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/) - Data validation using Python type hints
- [Uvicorn](https://www.uvicorn.org/) - ASGI server implementation




## Connect to GitHub

Go to GitHub → create a new repository (skip README if you want VS Code to handle it).

Copy the repository URL.

In VS Code terminal (Ctrl+` / Cmd+`):

git remote add origin https://github.com/username/my-project.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

## Push from VS Code

Alternatively, after adding the remote, you can click the … → Push button in the Source Control panel.

✅ Your project is now on GitHub directly from VS Code!

If you want, I can make a super-simple VS Code workflow cheat sheet with exact buttons and commands to copy-paste for GitHub. It’s very handy. Do you want me to make it?

You said:
Each case-search endpoint should accept (via JSON body or query params):
State (text, e.g., "KARNATAKA")
Commission (text, e.g., "Bangalore 1st & Rural Additional")
Search Value (string, e.g., "Reddy")




Got it! You want to design an API endpoint (probably in your backend) where users can search for cases using State, Commission, and Search Value. Here’s a clear explanation and example implementation for a Node.js + Express backend:

1. API Design

Endpoint:

POST /case-search


Request Body (JSON):

{
  "state": "KARNATAKA",
  "commission": "Bangalore 1st & Rural Additional",
  "searchValue": "Reddy"
}


Alternatively, you can support query params for GET requests:

GET /case-search?state=KARNATAKA&commission=Bangalore 1st & Rural Additional&searchValue=Reddy


Response (JSON example):

[
  {
    "caseId": "1234",
    "title": "Reddy vs State",
    "state": "KARNATAKA",
    "commission": "Bangalore 1st & Rural Additional",
    "date": "2025-08-27"
  },
  ...
]


✅ Key Notes

Make the search case-insensitive (toLowerCase() in filter).

You can later replace cases array with a database query (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, etc.).

Accepting both JSON body and query params is possible, but usually POST with JSON body is cleaner for search filters.

If you want, I can also write the MongoDB version of this endpoint that queries a real database collection instead of using mock data.

## project setup

1 pip install crawl4ai
2 crawl4ai-setup
3 python3 main.py
4 python3 main2.py
5 pip install fastapi uvicorn 
6 uvicorn main3:app --reload  Go to link and /docs
7 uvicorn main4:app --reload   in execution add url after that /sitemap.xmlp




Got it 👍 You want me to prepare a README.md file for your project that explains all the steps clearly. Here’s a clean version you can copy-paste into your GitHub repo:

# Crawl4AI Project

This project demonstrates how to set up and run different Python scripts and FastAPI applications using **Crawl4AI**.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install crawl4ai

2️⃣ Run Setup
crawl4ai-setup

3️⃣ Run main.py
python3 main.py

4️⃣ Run main2.py
python3 main2.py

🌐 Running FastAPI Applications
Install FastAPI and Uvicorn
pip install fastapi uvicorn

5️⃣ Run main3.py

Start the FastAPI server:

uvicorn main3:app --reload


Open your browser and go to:
👉 http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Here you can explore the API with Swagger UI.

6️⃣ Run main4.py

Start the FastAPI server:

uvicorn main4:app --reload


To test the execution, add a URL after /sitemap.xmlp, e.g.:
👉 http://127.0.0.1:8000/sitemap.xmlp?url=https://example.com

📌 Notes

Make sure Python 3.9+ is installed.

Use a virtual environment (venv) to avoid dependency conflicts.

Replace example.com with your target site when testing.
